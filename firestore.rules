/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. The primary goal is to
 * secure user profile data, ensuring that users can only access and modify their own
 * information. All data is scoped to the authenticated user.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized under a single top-level collection `/users`, where
 * each document's ID `{userId}` corresponds directly to a user's Firebase Authentication UID.
 * This path-based ownership is the foundation of the security model.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disabled: Listing the entire `/users` collection is explicitly forbidden
 *   to protect user privacy and prevent scraping of user data.
 * - Strict Ownership: All read and write operations on a user's document are restricted
 *   to the authenticated user who owns that document.
 * - Self-Creation: Authenticated users are permitted to create their own user profile document,
 *   a necessary step for new user onboarding flows.
 * - Default Deny: Any access that is not explicitly granted is denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The authorization model relies entirely on the document path
 * (`/users/{userId}`) matching the authenticated user's UID. This is the most efficient
 * security pattern as it requires no extra document reads (`get` calls) to make an
 * authorization decision. The user's `id` field within the document is also enforced to align
 * with the path, ensuring relational integrity.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: This principle is not applicable in this simple model, as there is
 * only one type of data (private user profiles) and no public/private distinction within
 * a single collection.
